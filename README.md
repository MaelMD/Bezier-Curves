# Bezier-Curves

<br>

A <b>Bezier<b> curve is a mathematically defined curve used in two-dimensional graphic applications. The curve is defined by four points: the initial position and the terminating position (which are called "anchors") and two separate middle points (which are called "handles"). The shape of a Bezier curve can be altered by moving the handles. The mathematical method for drawing curves was created by Pierre BÃ©zier in the late 1960's for the manufacturing of automobiles at Renault.
